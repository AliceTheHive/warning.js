Warning.js is a tiny JavaScript library which promotes JavaScript-free browsing and warns users with JavaScript enabled browsers.

This project was inspired by all the `<noscript>` tags asking us to enable JavaScript.


## Installation & Usage

Simply download `warning.js` from the repo and include it in your project's HTML code:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="warning.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

## Motivation

JavaScript is the biggest attack surface in the world of web. Our best weapon against these attacks and tracking is turning JavaScript off.
Many sites don't respect security/privacy and encourage their users to activate JavaScript, so we need a tool to fight back.

Warning.js aims to educate users about possible harms of using JavaScript.
