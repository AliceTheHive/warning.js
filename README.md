Warning.js is a tiny JavaScript library which promotes JavaScript-free browsing and warns users with JavaScript enabled browsers.

This project was inspired by all the `<noscript>` tags asking us to enable JavaScript.


## Installation & Usage

Simply download `warning.js` from the repo and include it in your project's HTML code:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="warning.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```
